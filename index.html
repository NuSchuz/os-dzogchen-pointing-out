      <p>Left dot steps through the four phases of an iteration: <em>phenomenon → space → revelation → rest</em>. When you reach the end of the iteration the left dot disables and the right dot becomes available to start the next iteration. At that same moment an <strong>anchor</strong> (a lineage quote) becomes available — press it once to receive a short pointing-out quote that fades in and out over 30 seconds.</p>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Anchor quotes are drawn from recognized Dzogchen masters as pointers. They are intended as invitations to look, not as guarantees or substitutes for direct teaching with a qualified teacher.</p>
